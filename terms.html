									<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
									<div class="description" style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%;">
										Client Engagement with Wallify Technologies is subjected to following Terms and Conditions:

Wallify technologies’ services agreement
These terms (“Terms”) cover the use of those Wallify Technologies’ consumer products, mobile apps, websites, and services listed herein this agreement (the “Services”). You accept these Terms by creating a Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account, through your use of the Services, or by continuing to use the Services after being notified of a change to these Terms.
1. Your privacy
Your privacy is important to us. Please read the Wallify Technologies Privacy Statement, (collectively "Privacy Statements") as they describe the types of data we collect from you and your devices ("Data") and how we use your Data. The Privacy Statements also describe how Wallify Technologies uses your content, which is your communications with others; postings or feedback submitted by you to Wallify Technologies via the Services; and the files, photos, documents, audio, digital works, and videos that you upload, store or share through the Services ("Your Content"). By using the Services or agreeing to these Terms, you consent to Wallify Technologies’ collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data as described in the Privacy Statements. TalentClouds will not share your data with any third party or advertisers. TalentClouds uses de-identified data to provide relevant contextual information at different points in time.
Code of conduct
a. By agreeing to these Terms, you’re agreeing that, when using the Services, you will follow these rules:
	•	Don’t do anything illegal.
	•	Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms, or threatens to harm children/teacher/School Management.
	•	Don’t send spam. Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages), emails, or instant messages to or service phone number and email
	•	Don’t publicly display or use the Services to share inappropriate Content or material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, graphic violence, or criminal activity).
	•	Don’t engage in activity that is false or misleading (e.g., asking for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone else, manipulating the Services to increase play count, or affect rankings, ratings, or comments).
	•	Don’t circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Services.
	•	Don’t engage in activity that is harmful to you, the Services, or others (e.g., transmitting viruses, stalking, communicating hate speech, or advocating violence against others).
	•	Don’t infringe upon the rights of others.
	•	Don’t engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.
	•	Don’t help others break these rules.
b. Enforcement. If you violate these Terms, we may stop providing Services to you or we may close your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account. We may also block delivery of a communication (like email or instant message) to or from the Services in an effort to enforce these Terms or we may remove or refuse to publish Your Content for any reason. When investigating alleged violations of these Terms, Wallify Technologies reserves the right to review Your Content in order to resolve the issue. However, we cannot monitor the entire Services and make no attempt to do so.


Using the services & support.
a. Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account:
You’ll need a Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account to access many of the Services. Your account lets you sign in to products, websites, mobile app and services provided by Wallify Technologies and some Wallify Technologies partners.
1. Creating an account. You can create a Wallify Technologies account or a TalentClouds account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account. If you create a Wallify Technologies account on behalf of an entity, such as your institution, business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account.
2.  Account use. You must use your Wallify Technologies account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a 12-month period to keep your Wallify Technologies account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Wallify Technologies account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Wallify Technologies account. If we reasonably suspect that your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account is being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Wallify Technologies may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.
3.  Kids and accounts. By using the Services, you represent that you have either reached the age of "majority" where you live or have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help before you create a Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor that creates a Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account, you accept these Terms on the minor’s behalf and are responsible for all use of the Wallify Technologies account, TalentClouds account, or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.
4. Closing your account
a. Closure
	•	You can cancel specific services or close your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account at any time and for any reason. To close your Wallify Technologies account, please contact your institution; if you are a institution email us at support@wallify.in. When you ask us to close your Wallify Technologies account, we will put it in a suspended state for 60 days just in case you change your mind. After that 60 day period, your Wallify Technologies account will be closed. See section 4(a)(iv)(2) below for a detailed explanation as to what happens when your Wallify Technologies account is closed. Logging back in during that 60 day period will reactivate your Wallify Technologies account.
	•	If your services are canceled or your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Services stops immediately and your license to use the software related to the Services ends. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account (unless we are required by law to keep it). You should have a regular backup plan as Wallify Technologies won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose access to material or products you’ve acquired.
b. Additional equipment/data plans
To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and/or equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.
c. Service notifications.
When there’s something important to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications to the email associated with your Wallify Technologies account or, for TalentClouds notifications, your TalentClouds account. If you authorized use of your phone number for your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account, then we may send Service notifications to you via SMS (text message). Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.


d. Customer support for the services is available on www.talentclouds.in
When there’s something important to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications to the email associated with your Wallify Technologies account or, for TalentClouds notifications, your TalentClouds account. If you authorized use of your phone number for your Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account, then we may send Service notifications to you via SMS (text message). Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.
Service availability.
	•	 We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and Wallify Technologies is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. In the event of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve Your Content or Data that you’ve stored temporarily. However we promise to restore back the application within 4 days or otherwise stated in Statement of Work
Updates to the services or software, and changes to these terms.
	•	We may change these Terms at any time, and we’ll tell you when we do so. Using the Services after the changes become effective means that you agree to the new terms. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services, close your Wallify Technologies account and/or TalentClouds account and, if you are a parent or guardian, help your minor child close his or her Wallify Technologies account or TalentClouds account.
	•	Sometimes you’ll need software updates to keep using the Services. We may automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the Services, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices. You may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates are subject to these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply. Wallify Technologies isn’t obligated to make any updates available and we don’t guarantee that we will support the version of the system for which you licensed the software.
Software license.
Unless accompanied by a separate Wallify Technologies Statement Of Work (SOW) agreement, any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these Terms.
a. If you comply with these Terms, we shall grant you the right to install and/or use one copy of the software per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one person at a time as part of your use of the Services.
b. The software is licensed, not sold, and Wallify Technologies reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Wallify Technologies, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. This license does not give you any right to, and you may not:
	•	circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Services;
	•	disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, emulate, exploit, or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so;
	•	separate components of the software or Services for use on different devices;
	•	publish, copy, rent, lease, sell, export, import, distribute, or lend the software or the Services, unless Wallify Technologies expressly authorizes you to do so;
	•	transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access or use the Services;
	•	use the Services in any unauthorized way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them or gain access to any service, data, account, or network;
Payment terms.
If you purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them.
	•	Charges. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. The price for TalentClouds paid products excludes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Wallify Technologies or TalentClouds account was registered. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network which masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.
	•	Your billing account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service. You can access and change your billing information and payment method by contacting our Business Development Associate mentioned in SOW. Additionally, you agree to permit Wallify Technologies to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to keep your billing account and contact information current at all times. Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.
	•	Billing. By providing Wallify Technologies with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method that you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize Wallify Technologies to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Wallify Technologies to charge you for any paid feature of the Services that you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.
	•	Refund policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Wallify Technologies has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.
	•	Canceling the services. You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. Please send an email to support@wallify.in for details on the cancellation process & formalities prevailing at that time. You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; or (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. If you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled.
	•	Trial-period offers. If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you must cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring new charges, unless we notify you otherwise. If you do not cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period, we may charge you for the Service(s).
	•	Price changes. We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.
	•	Payments to you. If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may also reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.
